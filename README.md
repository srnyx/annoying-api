# Annoying API [![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/srnyx/annoying-api.svg)](https://annoying-api.srnyx.com/jitpack)

General purpose API for my plugins. Just contains some utility classes and methods. *[Okay... it contains a tad bit more than that...](#developers)*

It's technically a framework/library, but I didn't know the difference when I was naming it, so oh well!

## Server Owners

All plugins that use Annoying API come with it pre-packaged. **So, you DON'T need to install it separately!**
