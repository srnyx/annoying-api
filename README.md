# Annoying API [![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/srnyx/annoying-api.svg)](https://annoying-api.srnyx.com/jitpack)

General purpose API for my plugins. Just contains some utility classes and methods. *[Okay... it contains a tad bit more than that...](#developers)*

It's technically a framework, but I didn't know the difference when I was naming it, so oh well!

## Server Owners

All of my plugins use AnnoyingAPI, however, they all come pre-packaged with it. **So, you don't need to install it separately.**

This may be different for other plugins that **aren't** mine, though. Just check their plugin pages / dependency lists to see if you need to install AnnoyingAPI separately.
